The production lasts for 10 minutes, and is done entirely in stereoscopic 3D, featuring a medley of songs from the different DX movies, as well as some brand new songs. The dance production itself was released in movie theatres on 5 August 2011, accompanied by the release of a brand new single, Pretty Cure All Stars 3D Theatre Theme Song Single. The movie starts when a pink shooting star falls down from the night sky and soughts out a toy store, striking one of the Cure Dolls of Melody on display. The Melody Doll comes alive, freeing herself from her box. Jumping to the floor, she explores the toy store when she hears the noise of a crowd coming from outside. Running out of the store, she discovers a huge TV screen which reflects a \"real-life\" image of herself. Playing around with it, she is soon joined by a Cure Doll of Rhythm. The two spot Hummy, waiting several floors down on the dance floor, who waved at them and sends up two rainbow keyboards to the Cure Dolls. Nodding to each other, the two slide down the keyboard onto the dance floor, and the concert began. The concert ends with a shot of the huge TV screen shown during the introduction.

The class that produced three perfect seasons in a row, with five once-in-a generation players, called \"The Generation of Miracles.\" There was another player who all of them respected... A legendary 6th player. An up-and-coming power player, Taiga Kagami, is just back from America. When he comes to Seirin High School, he meets the super-ordinary boy, Tetsuya Kuroko. Kagami is shocked to find that Kuroko isn't good at basketball, in fact, he's bad! And he's so plain that he's impossible to see. But Kuroko's plainness lets him pass the ball around without the other team noticing him, and he's none other than the sixth member of the Miracle Generation. Kuroko makes a pact with Kagami to defeat the other members of the Miracle Generation, who have all played basketball at other schools. A battle of light (Kagami) and shadow (Kuroko) begins! googletag.cmd.push(function() {\ngoogletag.defineSlot('/84947469/02PCAnimeSAFEtopLB01', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3').addService(googletag.pubads());\ngoogletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest();\ngoogletag.enableServices();\n}); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3'); });","id":163238}],"14":[{"a":6,"id":163230},{"a":26,"id":163231},{"a":16,"id":163232},{"a":17,"id":163233}],"15":[{"a":8.6,"b":7888,"c":166886,"d":102358,"id":163234}],"2":[{"a":"Kuroko no Basket","id":163237}],"i":14746},"resource_uri":"/api/query/14746"},{"i":{"11":[{"a":11773,"b":3,"c":1,"e":"ToHeart2\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30d9\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba","f":"http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/36361.jpg","id":163252}],"12":[{"a":1329910954,"b":1343216554,"e":2,"f":60,"g":1,"h":30,"i":"According to Amazon Japan, a two-volume OVA series \"ToHeart 2 Dungeon Travelers\" was announced.  \"ToHeart 2 Dungeon Travelers\" is an RPG game on PlayStaion Portable released in 2011. googletag.cmd.push(function() {\ngoogletag.defineSlot('/84947469/02PCAnimeNOTtopLB01', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1424160386148-3').addService(googletag.pubads());\ngoogletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest();\ngoogletag.enableServices();\n}); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1424160386148-3'); });","id":163263}],"14":[{"a":5,"id":163253},{"a":6,"id":163254},{"a":25,"id":163255},{"a":10,"id":163256},{"a":18,"id":163257},{"a":3,"id":163258}],"15":[{"a":6.5,"b":1,"c":1894,"d":741,"id":163259}],"2":[{"a":"To Heart 2: Dungeon Travelers","id":163262}],"i":14748},"resource_uri":"/api/query/14748"},{"i":{"11":[{"a":11777,"b":7,"c":1,"e":"\u30eb\u30d1\u30f3\u4e09\u4e16 \u8840\u306e\u523b\u5370 - \u6c38\u9060\u306eMermaid","f":"http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/32929.jpg","id":163300}],"12":[{"a":1322826154,"b":1322826154,"e":1,"f":92,"g":1,"h":92,"i":"Two jewels are the key to the ancient treasure of Yaobikuni.

However, not all students are overachievers, and for those like Yuki Ojima, groups like the Food Research Club are welcome havens in which to slack-off. But what's a slacker to do when the radical new candidate for Student Council president announces her intent to get rid of clubs like the FRC? Well, getting the help of the current Student Council president is a good start, but HIS suggestion is so counter-intuitive that it's crazy: Yuki should run for the Student Council himself? And yet, it's SO crazy that it just might work! Especially when Chisato, the chocolate-adverse president of the FRC (and Yuki's best childhood friend,) and members of other targeted school clubs start to join the swelling FRC army.

No one knows why. No one knows how. But the horrifying tale and the legends of the ghostly haunting that followed live on to this day. Perhaps it's not so surprising then, that among Seikyou's many school clubs is one for students interested in \"paranormal investigations.\" What might raise more than a few hairs, however, is that the founder of the club is the ghost herself. Unable to remember how she died and trapped in the grey land between life and death, Yuuko latches onto Teiichi Niiya, a freshman who can inexplicably see her, and together they and the other unsuspecting members of the club begin to unravel the many dark mysteries that surround Seikyou. Will unlocking the secret of Yuuko's gruesome death finally free her? Or will her sudden close association with a mortal have even stranger repercussions on both of their existences?

Until then, Kaoru was an honor roll student who tended to keep to himself, but meeting notorious bad boy Sentaro Kawabuchi starts to change him. Through his devil-may-care classmate, Kaoru learns the attractions of jazz and finds the first person he can call a \"friend\". He also discovers how much fun it is to play music with a pal. Other characters include Sentaro's kind childhood chum, Ritsuko, who is the daughter of a record shop owner; the mysterious upperclassman, Yurika; and Brother Jun, the much-admired leader among their peers.

The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world's entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack ('Bishounen-Killer') Bancoran. Bancoran's nickname doesn't mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran's eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour's flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran's palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang's Metropolis, while Jack's 'apartment' bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst's spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around. googletag.cmd.push(function() {\ngoogletag.defineSlot('/84947469/02PCAnimeSAFEtopLB01', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3').addService(googletag.pubads());\ngoogletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest();\ngoogletag.enableServices();\n}); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3'); });","id":171548}],"14":[{"a":5,"id":171539},{"a":6,"id":171540},{"a":21,"id":171541},{"a":22,"id":171542},{"a":40,"id":171543}],"15":[{"a":6.74,"c":204,"d":39,"id":171544}],"2":[{"a":"Patalliro!
