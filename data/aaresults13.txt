The twist is that Sunred (referred to most characters familiar with him as Red-san) is a rough-talking, violent and rude hero while the villains of Florsheim (led by General Vamp) are for the most part polite, conscientious and easy-going. Despite this, both sides still stay true to their roles, with Florsheim dedicated to destroying Sunred and taking over the world while Sun Red battles against them. Other evil organisations and heroes are also mentioned from time to time. Each episode is divided into various shorts of varying length. Most of the humour comes from the interactions of the characters, especially the main trio of Sunred, his girlfriend Kayoko and General Vamp. Kayoko and Vamp, for example, get along very well and she occasionally consults him about housework or cooking. In contrast, she and Sunred often argue like a long married couple.

He was famous for his violent temper and now he is lashing out at his three gunmen, who had been ordered to bring back Pero, but had returned empty-handed. Pero, a former subject of the angry King, had lived in Cat Country once but he had dared to save a mouse from death. Now, as everyone knows, the mouse is the mortal enemy of all cats, so the King orders his three gunmen to go to the ends of the earth, if necessary, to find Pero. Pero is a happy-go-lucky sort of feline and very hip for a cat. Fleeing from the wrath of the King, he decides to seek his fortune in the wild and wooly west. On the way, he encounters the King\u2019s gunmen hot on his trail but he foils them and blithely goes on his way. On the stagecoach to Go Go Town, he meets Annie, a pretty girl who is returning after finishing her education in the East, and Jimmy, a boy with sleepy eyes and slow movements. They are attacked suddenly by holdups who are after the new sheriff but since he does not seem to be on the coach, they ride off. Sad news awaits Annie in town. Her father had been killed by the Big Bad Boss for finding out about the bogus money he was making to get rich fast. The Big Bad Boss also kills each new sheriff who arrives to keep law and order in town. He is determined to keep the whole place under his thumb. The Big Bad Boss tries to scare Annie into leaving town but she is her father\u2019s daughter and cannot be frightened away by threats. With the help of Pero and Jimmy, she opens a restaurant in the building her father owned. Once again, Pero happens to save a little Indian mouse caught in a trap. The little mouse\u2019s father, the Chieftain of the Indian mice, promises to help Pero and Annie. The sleepy-eyed Jimmy is really the new sheriff.

The audience is expected to be enamored with this vehicle. At one scene when it looks like the tank is sure to get away, the background music turns into cocktail-lounge jazz and sparkly lights swirl around the tank. The tank carries six ATGM launchers (which Ken is somehow able to dislodge with minimal trouble, along with a piece of the turret, towards the end of the movie), three to each side of the turret, and a laser-based machine-gun-esque installment, in addition to its rifled main gun. The tank's treads are dual-mounted (the tread is split in half, making four sets of treads for the tank). The employment of the laser, however, seems counter-productive to a machine-gun's mission, as it can only fire once every few seconds. If it can fire at higher rates, it does not do so, and tries to acquire a lock on its pursuer (Blader, in this case). This suggests a low ammunition capacity, unlike thousand-round-and-up machine-guns routinely mounted on modern tanks. It does not appear to have any effect on the road, either, which does not say much about its power. Another tank involved is the MBT-90D, which are dispatched by the Army (or Air Force\u2014the movie never makes it clear if it is a joint effort, although the general who arrives midway into the movie is shown riding in something resembling an ADATS) to take out the tank. Despite having at least a platoon of these, the MBT-99 still evades capture. The M-90Ds are armed with a three-barreled autocannon, the calibre of which may be around fifteen to twenty millimeters. The MBT-90D is equipped with three ATGM missile launchers, on the left side of the turret, and its main cannon is mounted on the front, instead of on a turret. After the MBT-99's hijackers (who appear inside the tank after getting away from a recently-committed bank robbery), hired by a shadowy group, backed by a foreign nation seeking an edge in their military (the M-99 is presumably on its way to be tested at a separate base), are forced out by Ken and his team, Eleanor enters to study the tank, and it starts up on its own, having been programmed by the hijackers to head for a pier and drive off its end so as to rendezvous with an enemy submarine. The rest of the movie is made up of the chase through the city, resulting in the destruction of another bank (owned by the same corporation that built the first bank in the movie), and various collateral damage. googletag.cmd.push(function() {\ngoogletag.defineSlot('/84947469/02PCAnimeSAFEtopLB01', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3').addService(googletag.pubads());\ngoogletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest();\ngoogletag.enableServices();\n}); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3'); });","id":94198}],"14":[{"a":4,"id":94191},{"a":36,"id":94192},{"a":7,"id":94193},{"a":19,"id":94194}],"15":[{"a":6.08,"b":1,"c":267,"d":121,"id":94195}],"2":[{"a":"Techno Police 21C","id":94197}],"i":8163},"resource_uri":"/api/query/8163"},{"i":{"11":[{"a":5091,"b":1,"c":1,"d":"Ninja the Wonder Boy","e":"\u307e\u3093\u304c\u733f\u98db\u4f50\u52a9","f":"http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/57257.jpg","id":94212}],"12":[{"a":308315454,"b":324645054,"e":24,"f":480,"g":2,"h":20,"i":"Sasuke is the story of a ninja child that starts right after the battle of Sekigahara where Tokugawa Ieyasu becomes shogun of Japan.

The Three Kingdoms period has been a popular theme in Japanese manga for decades, but Souten Kouro differs greatly from most of the others on several points. One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade. A consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.

While his eye is sealed, Sharaku knows nothing of his true nature or his power, and does not remember his evil half's sinister attempts to conquer the world. googletag.cmd.push(function() {\ngoogletag.defineSlot('/84947469/02PCAnimeSAFEtopLB01', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3').addService(googletag.pubads());\ngoogletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest();\ngoogletag.enableServices();\n}); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3'); });","id":96173}],"14":[{"a":5,"id":96168}],"15":[{"a":7.0,"b":3,"c":259,"d":67,"id":96169}],"2":[{"a":"Mitsume ga Tooru","id":96172}],"i":8352},"resource_uri":"/api/query/8352"},{"i":{"11":[{"a":5250,"b":1,"c":1,"e":"\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30de\u30b8\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc","f":"http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/10504.jpg","id":96187}],"12":[{"a":450011503,"b":467377903,"e":23,"f":460,"g":0,"h":20,"i":"The story is set in modern times, but the twist to the story is that Mazinger is an ancient weapon of the gods, left on earth to battle the evil space gods who have returned to take over the universe. googletag.cmd.push(function() {\ngoogletag.defineSlot('/84947469/02PCAnimeSAFEtopLB01', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3').addService(googletag.pubads());\ngoogletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest();\ngoogletag.enableServices();\n}); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3'); });","id":96193}],"14":[{"a":36,"id":96188}],"15":[{"a":6.97,"b":3,"c":663,"d":187,"id":96189}],"2":[{"a":"God Mazinger","id":96192}],"i":8354},"resource_uri":"/api/query/8354"},{"i":{"11":[{"a":5251,"b":3,"c":1,"e":"\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u4f1d\u8aac","f":"http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/27104.jpg","id":96206}],"12":[{"a":850475503,"b":850475503,"e":2,"f":48,"g":0,"h":24,"i":"Angel Densetsu is a story about Seiichirou Kitano, a kind and naive boy with the heart of an angel, but the sinister looks of a devil.

From his father he inherited the love for baseball and his great abilities for such sport, although his mother and his older sister try to avoid that he practices it. In fact, his father, before dying, had time to teach him a magical shoot. Dome, after his mother gave him the glove his father used, he makes that shot in a training session of the Giants and is contracted immediately. With the support of the veteran players of the team, this young player will, from this very moment, make the Giants become unbeatable at home and none of the main batters of the Japanese professional league manages to end with his magical shot. Although that does not apply to the games played away, as Dome is just allowed to play at home, in the Tokyo Dome in which his father was consacrated (and the place by which he did chose such name for his son). When the veteran captain of the Dragons manages to bat his shot, it seems that the young boy is finally and definitely defeated, but then he invents another magical shot.

The continent, called Europa, is divided into two main powers: The Imperial Empire, a monarchy in the east, and the alliance of democracies called the Federation in the west. In this world, there is a very important resource called ragnite; its uses range from fueling weapons of war to use in medical treatments. Since ragnite is such an important resource, the Federation and the Empire are constantly at war with each other for it. The story takes place in the neutral country of Gallia, known for its bountiful reserves of ragnite, when the Empire decides to invade and seize the ragnite for themselves. The story follows Welkin, the son of a former war hero; Isara, Welkin's Darcsen adoptive sister; and Alicia, a member of the Bruhl town watch, as they fight the Imperials in the ragtag Gallian militia group, Squad 7. Squad 7 fights to regain their homes and livelihoods with Welkin as the squad leader and commander of the Edelweiss tank; Alicia as a scout; Isara as the pilot of the Edelweiss, and a variety of colorful individuals. googletag.cmd.push(function() {\ngoogletag.defineSlot('/84947469/02PCAnimeSAFEtopLB01', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3').addService(googletag.pubads());\ngoogletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest();\ngoogletag.enableServices();\n}); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3'); });","id":99425}],"14":[{"a":4,"id":99418},{"a":21,"id":99419},{"a":13,"id":99420}],"15":[{"a":7.8,"b":393,"c":55582,"d":25799,"id":99421}],"2":[{"a":"Senjou no Valkyria: Gallian Chronicles","id":99424}],"i":8657},"resource_uri":"/api/query/8657"},{"i":{"11":[{"a":5515,"b":2,"c":1,"e":"\u60d1\u661f\u30ed\u30dc \u30c0\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9A[\u30a8\u30fc\u30b9] \u5b87\u5b99\u5927\u6d77\u6226","f":"http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/62699.jpg","id":99515}],"12":[{"a":259067614,"b":259067614,"e":1,"f":25,"g":2,"h":25,"i":"Doppler has set up a trap for the Jasdam, and it is up to the Danguard Ace to save it.
