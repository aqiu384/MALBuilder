He finally gets a break though, as he's sent by his company to the tropical seas of Eastern China to deliver a disc. But his boat gets hijacked by a band of mercenaries hired to retrieve the disc. Rock (as he is newly dubbed by his captors) catches the interest of the only female merc Revy as she thinks he's worth a ransom, taking him hostage. However, the disc that was stolen has a terrible secret that's unknown to Rock, which causes massive confusion and chaos for both him and his kidnappers. googletag.cmd.push(function() {\ngoogletag.defineSlot('/84947469/02PCAnimeSAFEtopLB01', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3').addService(googletag.pubads());\ngoogletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest();\ngoogletag.enableServices();\n}); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3'); });","id":21490}],"14":[{"a":4,"id":21484},{"a":3,"id":21485}],"15":[{"a":8.23,"b":5423,"c":205813,"d":120695,"id":21486}],"2":[{"a":"Black Lagoon","id":21489}],"i":1637},"resource_uri":"/api/query/1637"},{"i":{"11":[{"a":890,"b":1,"c":1,"d":"King of Braves GaoGaiGar","e":"\u52c7\u8005\u738b\u30ac\u30aa\u30ac\u30a4\u30ac\u30fc","f":"http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/21183.jpg","id":21513}],"12":[{"a":854794557,"b":886244157,"e":49,"f":1225,"g":4,"h":25,"i":"In the year 2005, a race of alien monsters called Zonders emerge from underground and launch a series of attacks on the city of Tokyo. The only defense against these creatures is the secret agency known as the Gutsy Geoid Guard (or 3G) and their ultimate weapon, the awesome giant robot GaoGaiGar. GaoGaiGar's pilot, Guy Shishio, is a former astronaut who was nearly killed two years before when the Zonders first crashed to earth. Guy's life was spared when a mysterious robot lion called Galeon pulled him from the burning shuttle and brought him to Earth. Guy's father, Leo, then used Galeon's technology to rebuild his shattered son as a cyborg, in the hopes that he could stop the aliens when they appear. Now, with Galeon as its core, GaoGaiGar fights to protect Earth. He is aided by a team of transforming robots and by a young boy named Mamoru, who has the power to purify the Zonders' cores, and seems to be connected to the mysterious Galeon.

Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his inappropriate behavior. A typical gag involves Shin-chan confounding his parents by using the wrong phrase for the occasion; for example, saying \"Welcome back!\" instead of \"I am back!\" when he comes home. During the beginning of the series, the TV show was mostly based on the storyline in the original manga. As the show progressed, more and more episodes became anime-original.
