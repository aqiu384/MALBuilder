Born August 11 1943, he was known as the director of several animations including VIFAM. Thus in 1998 a new TV series of VIFAM was broadcasted in memory of him. Televised 1998/3/21-1998/10/3 (in Kansai area), it contains 26 episodes, and like Twelve people disappeared it is a sidestory, but some new features are added: new persons, new RV, etc. The story could be inserted between #22 and #26 (#24 and #25 are digests) of VIFAM, and is divided into three parts: Act I (#1-14), Interlude (#15-18), Act II (#19-26), if we name them (in reality Act I and II have little relationship). It could also be the New Testament, but it is now regarded as an apocrypha (or worse, a pseudo-VIFAM). There are several reasons to say so, but to watch the story is the best way to understand them.

Ryo became involved with the Makuhari test course that Masato was also a part of. The leader, Gray Gear, told Ryo, \"If you want to know about Masato, come to the test course late at night and ride the new machine.\" When Ryo got in the new machine, the Vector Versus, and rode it around the course, he was able to exceed 300 kilometers per hour and suddenly warped into a mysterious space!

Like the previous movie, the stories deal with seeing the world through the eyes of people who are different from social norms.  The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature in 2008 from the Asia Pacific Screen Awards. 1. \"The Third Wish\u201d (AN Dong-hui, RYU Jeong-wu). A fairy godmother appears before a visually impaired young woman to grant her three wishes. But this is no fairytale. The irritable middle-aged fairy wants to finish her job as soon as possible. Yet she proves to be helpful as she leads the woman through a busy marketplace, which is delightfully reminiscent of \"Amelie\". But it's no walk in the park, as busy urbanites show no consideration for our protagonist. Yet she prevails through obstacles. With a walking stick, she taps together the heels of her shiny new shoes and follows the \"yellow brick road\" (guiding tiles for the visually impaired) around the city. 2. \"Ajukari\u201d (HONG Deok-pyo) is a street-style cartoon. It comically depicts how a certain macho \"complex\" can cripple men. Male circumcision becomes the ultimate standard for being \"manly\" and those who have failed to do the deed are forever fearful of going to public baths. 3. \"Baby\" (LEE Hong-su, LEE Hong-min) portrays the difficulties a career woman faces in having a child. \"I'm not saying you can't have maternity leave, but can you afford to raise a child while working?\" asks her boss. This smart story portrays everything from mother and daughter-in-law relationships to a parody of \"Tazza: The High Rollers\" and hilarious episodes where an \"ambulance bus\" picks up several patients en route. 4. \"Shine Shine Shining\" (KWON Mi-jeong) is drawn like a warm, watercolor storybook for children. Grade schooler Eun-jin is smart and popular, but she has a secret. She hides her curly hair, which she gets from her Filipino mother, in braids. 5. \"Merry Golasmas\" is an adorable claymation, or stop motion animation of models constructed from clay, plasticine, etc. It explores physical discrimination or stereotypes. In an open audition to find a Santa Claus, the real Santas \u00e2\u0080\u0095 one who's black, another who's Asian, a female Santa and one in a wheelchair \u00e2\u0080\u0095 lose to a fake Santa, a pot-bellied, Caucasian. 6. \u201cLies\" explores homosexuality. Drawn in pastel-like sketches with art deco-esque details, it is a stunning digital cut-out animation, A homosexual man is forced by his parents to marry a woman, while others are pressured to fake having a girlfriend or receive \"therapy\" to become straight.

Immediately before Germany is defeated by the Allies, Dr. Asagumo implants a card inscribed with the secret of Big X in his son, Shigeru, and is then shot to death by the German army. Twenty years later, the card is discovered in the body of Shigeru, who is then living in Tokyo.

The completed Big X is then revealed to be a drug that can expand the human body without limitation.
