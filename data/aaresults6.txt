Because his unemployed parents are good-for-nothings who waste what money they have on gambling, Hayate had to start working at a young age to help out his family. Although such experience has made him inhumanly fast and tough and skilled at things boys aren't normally skilled at, it has also left him in an awkward position, as his parents have racked up such a huge gambling debt that they have sold Hayate to the yakuza for the value of his organs. In a desperate attempt to avoid that fate, Hayate decides to become a \"bad guy\" and kidnap someone to be held for ransom, but his efforts to do so are mistaken as a confession of love by the girl he targets. When he helps save the (as it turns out) ultra-wealthy 13-year-old Nagi from real kidnappers, she takes him in and gives him a job as her new personal butler (and love interest) until he can pay off his debt. But Hayate is more attracted to Nagi's beautiful teenage maid Maria, and head butler Klaus is initially disapproving of a boy with such a poor look. And then there's Nagi's pet Tama, who is also a force to be reckoned with. googletag.cmd.push(function() {\ngoogletag.defineSlot('/84947469/02PCAnimeSAFEtopLB01', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3').addService(googletag.pubads());\ngoogletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest();\ngoogletag.enableServices();\n}); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1424159748733-3'); });","id":46298}],"14":[{"a":4,"id":46289},{"a":6,"id":46290},{"a":37,"id":46291},{"a":21,"id":46292},{"a":27,"id":46293}],"15":[{"a":7.85,"b":1328,"c":100809,"d":47231,"id":46294}],"2":[{"a":"Hayate no Gotoku!","id":46297}],"i":3675},"resource_uri":"/api/query/3675"},{"i":{"11":[{"a":2027,"b":7,"c":1,"f":"http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/24393.jpg","id":46310}],"12":[{"a":1102676367,"b":1102676367,"e":4,"f":48,"g":1,"h":12,"i":"Four 13 minute episodes that came with the DVDs.

The first deals with a group of young women who, after being out of school for a few years, are beginning to think about settling down. However, there is one member of the group who has no prospects, and Shizuka's friends are worried that her shyness will keep Mr. Right from noticing her beauty and character. They persuade her to join a dating service called The Wedding Club, but when her first match seems to be quite a dud, Shizuka wonders if a trip down the isle just isn't in her future. The second episode is about five sisters, only one of whom isn't married. What's more, the cool Kiyomi seems to have no interest whatsoever in finding a husband. Her sisters have other ideas, though, and when a co-worker asks her out on a date, the women convince the suitor to propose marriage that very night.This is easier said than done, however, as Kiyomi's attitude can be quite intimidating. The young man may not end up following through with the plan, but even if he does there is no guarantee that the headstrong lady in question will say yes.

The Special Edition episodes feature some new scenes and tweaks to previously animated scenes. The first special, The Empty Battlefield, which was episodes 1 to 21 of the series, was aired in two parts on Japanese TV in March 2004, followed by the next special, The Far-Away Dawn, which was episodes 22 to 40, in July 2004.
