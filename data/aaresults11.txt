(perhaps not surprising for being a film in which Hayao Miyazaki was involved) This film is one of the most rollicking and action-packed films made by Toei, and is in an outrageously cartoonish style breaking with the Toei mold. It has a spectacular lineup of animators including Yasuji Mori, Akira Daikubara, Hayao Miyazaki, Yoichi Kotabe and Reiko Okuyama. The original story about Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves itself is recounted at one point in the film in an unexpected and interesting way using shadow-puppets.

The ten officials of the noble family have decided to make Wolfram the next Maou, but now that Yuuri has returned and taken back his role as Maou, complications arise when one noble disagrees with Yuuri returning to the throne. In addition, an ancient secret society that threatens the peace of both humans and Mazoku has risen, and a fight for the throne that now leaves the nobles wondering who is the legitimate Maou.","id":607940}],"14":[{"a":11,"id":607932},{"a":17,"id":607933},{"a":12,"id":607934},{"a":3,"id":607935},{"a":5,"id":607936}],"15":[{"a":8.02,"b":113,"c":15164,"d":6209,"id":607937}],"2":[{"a":"Kyou kara Maou! 3rd Series","id":607938}],"i":65641},"resource_uri":"/api/query/65641"},{"i":{"11":[{"a":4081,"b":4,"c":2,"d":"Natsume's Book of Friends","e":"\u590f\u76ee\u53cb\u4eba\u5e33","f":"http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/10330.jpg","id":798945}],"12":[{"a":1215542974,"b":1222800574,"e":"Since he was young, a teenage boy named Natsume Takashi has been able to see youkai, but keeping this ability a secret has now become a heavy burden for him and has made his life difficult.
