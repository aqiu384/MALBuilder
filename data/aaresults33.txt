The Japan Ground-Self Defence Force immediately took action and pushed the fantasy creatures back to the \"Gate.\" To facilitate negotiations and prepare for future fights, the JGSDF dispatched the Third Reconnaissance Team to the \"Special Region\" at the other side of the Gate. Youji Itami, a JSDF officer as well as a 33-year-old otaku, was appointed as the leader of the Team. Amid attacks from enemy troops the team visited a variety of places and learnt a lot about the local culture and geography.

They began to exert diplomatic pressure over Japan. A suddenly appearing portal to an unknown world\u2014to the major powers it may be no more than a mere asset for toppling the international order.
